# Conquest DICOM docker image

This is a simple dockerized version of the Conquest DICOM server (see https://github.com/marcelvanherk/Conquest-DICOM-Server). 
This docker image contains just the basic dgate executable without the web interface.
Building the docker image is simple:

```
docker build -t rzinkstok/conquest .
```

The service can be started using `docker-compose`::

```
cd compose
docker-compose up -d
```

## Mounted folders

- `compose/data`: the folder containing DICOM files
- `compose/logs`: the log files generated by the dgate application
- `compose/config`: the configuration files used by dgate

## Configuration

Configuration of the server is specified in the `compose/config/dicom.ini` file. This file is generated on the fly from the `compose/config/dicom.ini.j2` template,
using some environment variables set in the `compose/.env` file. These are AETITLE and PORT: 
in changing these, you should update their value in the `.env` file and restart the whole stack.
 
For communication with other DICOM nodes, it is necessary to add them to the `compose/config/acrnema.map`. Remember
to use the hostname alias (`host.docker.internal`) for DICOM nodes running on the host machine. 


## To do
- Check and (if needed) fix connection to DICOM nodes on another host
- Look into a simple way of starting multiple instances
